Code for my Bachelor's Thesis at Maastricht University. Fulfilled in completion of the requirements for the BSc in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence. Thesis Title: "A Deep Learning Approach for Electrode Localization to Enable Truly Imageless ECGi".

## Training
To train a model, run the train.py script under the bachelors_thesis/modeling/ directory. Take a look at the config folder for the various configuration options. They can be overriden via the command line as well, e.g. 
```
> python bachelors_thesis/modeling/train.py model=aura12 run.epochs=10 batch.size=32 augment.augment=false 
```

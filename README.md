# Bachelors Thesis



Code for my Bachelor's Thesis at Maastricht University. Fulfilled in completion of the requirements for the BSc in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence. Thesis Title: "A Deep Learning Approach for Electrode Localization to Enable Truly Imageless ECGi".

## Training
To train a model, run the train.py script under the bachelors_thesis/modeling/ directory. Take a look at the config folder for the various configuration options. They can be overriden via the command line as well, e.g. 
```
> python bachelors_thesis/modeling/train.py model=aura12 run.epochs=10 batch.size=32 augment.augment=false 
```
If you are trying to train a model and you are not me (Nate), then you will probably have to disable wandb by passing `wandb.enabled=false`, or by changing the value in the config/wandb/default.yaml file. 

## Data
The AURA12 model requires the PTB-XL dataset, which can be downloaded [here](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/). Unzip the file into data/raw/ptb-xl/.
To process the data, run bachelors_thesis/dataset.py. This script has a cli to help you use it. It takes quite a few minutes to process the data, so be patient.
The processed data will be stored in the data/processed folder. This is where the models will search for their training/validation data.
